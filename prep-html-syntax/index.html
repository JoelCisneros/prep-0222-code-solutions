  <p style="color:pink;font-size: 25px;">
    Boba Fett is my favorite character in Star Wars
because he has undoubtedly the coolest armor and
abilities out of everyone. He is also a bounty hunter
born to the late, Jango Fett - who is also a Star Wars legend.
All in all, his lore and new Disney+ show are worth checking out...
they're seriously captivating!
